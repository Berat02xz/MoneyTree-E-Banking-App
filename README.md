# Project for High School State Matura

### Project Goal
According to research conducted by the 'Institute for the Development of Electronic Communications,' only 2 out of 14 banks in Macedonia offer a mobile application that enables cashless payments via the NFC standard. To raise awareness in this area, we created 'MoneyTree' - a simulated e-banking web application. From the homepage to user settings, security and optimization are our primary focus. Inspired by the creative mind of Kendrick Lamar, 'MoneyTree' aims to let you manage money as if you were growing it on trees - easily and simply.

### Features
Our web application is an all-in-one solution for viewing financial transactions, utilizing a robust data structure model. This platform provides historical transaction records that users can view and manipulate.

**Key Features:**
- **Transaction Management:** Users can sort, search, and view specific transactions.
- **Database Integration:** Complex integration of a database with client-side JavaScript ensures accurate and secure information display.

### Development Insights
This project is the result of intensive effort, comprising 6,930 lines of code, 30 images, and 3 videos. Despite the workload, the greatest benefit was the knowledge gained. Through this project, I learned how to connect databases to web pages, program in PHP, and use JavaScript libraries.

All these efforts and hours of learning were greatly inspired by the song 'MoneyTrees' by Kendrick Lamar. It motivated me to realize this project, which I now hope to share with others with the same passion and inspiration.
